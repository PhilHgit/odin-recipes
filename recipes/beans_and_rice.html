            In a separate pot or skillet, heat a tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add one diced onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.

            Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has thickened.
        </ul>
        <li>Combine and Serve</li>
